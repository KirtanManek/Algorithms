<h1><b>Here you will find implementation of algorithms in C language.</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Here clock.c is a file containing clock used to calculate the runtime of algorithm.</li>
  <li>file_generator.c is a file generates 1,00,000 numbers in 3 different sequences : 
    <ol>
      <li>Best Case --> Saves all numbers in best.txt file in already sorted manner.</li>
      <li>Worst Case --> Saves all numbers in worst.txt file in descending order in order to check worst case for your algorithm.</li>
      <li>Average Case --> Saves all files in average.txt in random manner(random() function used).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>And last but not least is template.c file. This file has clock integrated, also asks you which case you want your algorithm to run on, 
    saves the output in output.txt file and displayes the time taken by your algorithm.
  </li>
</ul>
