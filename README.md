<h1><b>Here you will find implementation of algorithms in C language.</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Here clock.c is a file containing clock used to calculate the runtime of algorithm.</li>
  <li>file_generator.c is a file generates 1,00,000 numbers in 3 different sequences : 
    <ol>
      <li>Best Case --> Saves all numbers in best.txt file in already sorted manner.</li>
      <li>Worst Case --> Saves all numbers in worst.txt file in descending order in order to check worst case for your algorithm.</li>
      <li>Average Case --> Saves all files in average.txt in random manner(random() function used).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
